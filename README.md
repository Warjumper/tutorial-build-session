# Achievements Round 2
## Tutorial build session
I chose to do the build sessson for "MAKING AN ACCESSIBLE HAMBURGER MENU" by Ashley Sheridan (http://www.ashleysheridan.co.uk/blog/Making+an+Accessible+Hamburger+Menu), but after speaking with the instructor and dealing with some problems related to some outdated code, I opted to go for a different tutorial.

## Second chance tutorial (and Code Attributions)
This time around, I went with a tutorial from WebDevSimplified on Responsive Navigation Bars that included a great section on a Responsive Hamburger design.
